</p><h4>This Webpage is made to Log the process of my Virtual World. My virtual world was created originally with the thought of making an interactive video game type expierience, but I have now decided to use this virtual world as a set piece for a cinematic video. This Virtual Space was made with a combination of assets pulled from unity asset store. Many prephabs were created using pre exiting game objects and particle simulations. I feel that the lighting, fog, and ambient sounds really create a more emersive enviroment. I plan on using the cinemachine assets provided by Unity in order to create my cinematic video, and it will include a diverse range of camera motions. I hope that through this project I will learn more about creating cinematic virtual scenes. </h4>
